## Friend or Foe: Vibro-Algal Interactions at the Phycosphere

# MOTIVATION 

Using our knowledge from previous investigations in Chapters 1 & 2, we propose to examine the relationship between predominant Vibrio species in the IRL and their identified algal partners/competitors. 

We plan to design manipulate experiments to investigate the functional implications of these partnerships and the "fluidity" of these relationships under fluctuating environmental conditions.
